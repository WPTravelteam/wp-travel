# WP Travel - üñ• Development Guide line.

## _‚è≥ Now is time to do great things._

To increase the productivity developers need to have common development setup. 

### üñã Editor
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Lets stick with this so that we can have common config for it.
#### üß© Extensions for VS Code
- [xDebug](https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug)
- [PHPCs](https://github.com/ikappas/vscode-phpcs)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)


### ‚úÖ Requirements

- [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) : We will be using this to run commands. ```Don't use: npm install```
- [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/)

### ‚òÅ Recommended
- [Local (By flywheel)](https://localwp.com/) for Local server
- [XDebug extension](https://github.com/pixeljar/local-addon-xdebug-vscode) for ```Local (By flywheel)```. Check [this for help](https://localwp.com/community/t/localbyflywheel-xdebug-vscode/11950/2).

### üõ† Setup plugin
```sh
# Clone WP Travel Repo 
git clone git@gitlab.com:ws-plugins/wp-travel.git

# Go to wp-travel folder
cd wp-travel

# Checkout to dev branch
git checkout dev

# Install all required packages.
yarn setup
```

### Issue with ```PHPCS``` in ```VS Code```.
Incase ```phpcs``` is not showing error in editor then:
- Create ```.vscode``` folder in ```wp-travel``` plugin folder.
- Create ```settings.json``` file inside ```.vscode```.
- Add following config inside ```settings.json```.

```json
{
    "phpcs.executablePath": "./vendor/bin/phpcs"
}
```
