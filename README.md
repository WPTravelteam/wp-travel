# WP Travel - üñ• Development Guide line.

## _‚è≥ Now is time to do great things._

To increase the productivity developers need to have common development setup. 

### üñã Editor
- [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : Lets stick with this so that we can have common config for it.
#### üß© Extensions for VS Code
- [xDebug](https://github.com/xdebug/vscode-php-debug)
- [PHPCs](https://github.com/ikappas/vscode-phpcs)
- [ESLint](https://github.com/Microsoft/vscode-eslint)


### ‚úÖ Requirements

| Package | Version |
| ----------- | ----------- |
| [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) | `14.5.0 (Recommended) or above` |
| [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) | `1.21.1 (Recommended) or above`  We will be using this to run commands. ```Don't use: npm install``` |
| [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) | `1.6.3 (Recommended) or above` |

### ‚òÅ Recommended
- [Local (By flywheel)](https://localwp.com/) for Local server

### üõ† Setup plugin

### ‚ÅâÔ∏è Issue with ```PHPCS``` in ```VS Code```.
Incase ```phpcs``` is not showing error in editor then:
- Create ```.vscode``` folder in ```wp-travel``` plugin folder.
- Create ```settings.json``` file inside ```.vscode```.
- Add following config inside ```settings.json```.

```json
{
    "phpcs.executablePath": "./vendor/bin/phpcs"
}
```
